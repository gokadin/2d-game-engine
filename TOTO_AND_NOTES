BUGS
=======================================================================================================================

invalid coordinates at game startup (sometimes)
skill bar y position has to be manually set or it's too low


NOTES
=======================================================================================================================

Basically need to have a predefined table with offsets in sprites for synchronising character and equipment animations.

Would be cool to have multi skill interactions. Example you cast a tornado first and then ignite it with some other fire spell.
